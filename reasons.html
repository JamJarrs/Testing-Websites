        <p>Ah yes, why indeed? Well I believe it is for the following reasons</p>
        <ul>
            <li>He never gives up, despite how much things get on top of him, he always eventually gets bak up and tries again</li>
            <li>He always has a plan to get better even if plans in the past don't go exactly how we want them to</li>
            <li>He is extremely fun, both in jokes, silly bits or in plans for activites</li>
            <li>He has to be one of the most helpful people I know, anytime anyone he loves is in any kind of trouble he will drop everything to help</li>
            <li>I have suspicions he may be a <a href="wizard.html"> wizard</a></li>
        </ul>
